I eventually ended up creating a new "client" and hooking the new message event to send a pushbullet notification to my phone when I get highlighted.

I'd worked with NodeJS before, and the developer had a default remote MongoDB database which made it very easy to setup.</p>
          <p>I ended up reskinning theming Bootstrap for them, and refactoring all the views (<a href="https://i.imgur.com/laIdySZ.png">old frontpage</a>). I implemented saner pagination, along with a pagination widget.</p>

          <p>After Ashfire made his graphs private. I decided to go ahead with a project I’d been holding off because he had already made a solution. I installed MongoDB + PyMongo and wrote a script to poll the server list periodically, then store the resulting JSON in the database. Once that was done, I modified my flask web server for the server list to serve a simple graph using <a href="http://www.highcharts.com/products/highstock">HighStocks</a>. It uses ajax to fetch the data from the database as I did not store the derived data (the player count). Instead each request will parse X data points of server list jsons which makes it useful as a local application only.</p>

          <p>During the Beta for hawken, the developers turned off the server browser to maximize the usage of their matchmaking (in order to perfect it). This made those who wanted to setup an organized scrim very painful. I checked out how Hawken retrived the list and put together a simple interactive table using jQuery and Datatables. To actually fetch the data, I had to create a simple library in python 2.x for Hawken’s services as Javascript by itself would fail (due to some overhead required in XHRs). I then used it in combination with Flask as a proxy in order to filter and combine multiple requests together. The result would show the users on the server, the map, and the ip address + port the server is running on.</p>

          <p>I took over a writing a friend’s plugin for the <a href="http://pridemc.com/">Pride PvP Games</a> server. Essentially, I put into practice the game mechanics of a Deathmatch arena in the style of the Hunger Games. Actually, it’s not that much like it as there’s no cornicopia danger. You choose a kit (class) and there a grace period when there’s no PvP. My personal highlight of this project is the that I shosed the status of the arena with signs around the portal you enter. Giving a very good user feedback about the sate of the arena. While I don’t have credit for the idea, I also added a gate that closes down to prevent people from walking though the portal (as opposed to just not teleporting them).</p>

          <p>This project was spurred by the fact that <a href="http://dev.bukkit.org/server-mods/bpermissions/">bPermissions</a>’s promotion system limitations. While it focus’s on tracks, the actual permission node for each track uses one node per group. My desired setup was that normal users could promote Guests. Giving users the <code>promote.User</code> permission node would then allow users the ability to both promote to guests to User and to demote them from it. Not ideal. While I first debated forking and submitting a patch (which I half did), I also wanted the promotion commands to be more configurable. Currently they were <code>/promote [trackname]</code>. Which would force a mod use the command more than once to go all the way from Guest => Mod.</p>

          <p>I started getting re-involved with Towny’s development, and got some inspiration from users about how to do warring Nations. I also took a gander at some of the mechanics of a similar plugin that did PvP stuff right, Factions. I coded up some threaded tasks that created a huge beacon in the sky overtop the area under attack. The game mechanic was to attack and hold the area. Towny’s war event is the same thing, but there’s nothing physical. So I created a focus for the defenders. Attacking would have the attacker place a flag, which the defenders would need to break / take down. I eventually merged this into the Towny plugin.</p>

So I took a second shot at Pygame (I’d tried to port an old Turing project before). I managed to get the isometric down right, as with the height levels, but my code re-rendered the whole map every tick which was terrible so I scrapped the project.</p>

          <p>I converted Towny to Bukkit when it became apparent hMod was dieing. The initial release didn’t include the wall generation code, however I did add iConomy support as well as a taxation system. I then coded up a (rather sloppy) implementation of having residents own plots inside towns.The rewrite had me focus on getters/setters, exception handling (as well as custom exceptions), as well as focus on the inevitable problem the hMod had. hMod didn’t plan for when Minecraft would eventually allow users to move between more than one world on a single server, but the Bukkit dev’s had foresight.</p>

          <p>After I first got the spark to start writing Towny, I wanted a visual representation of where the towns were. This lead me to expand on the Cartographer idea (a top down render of a minecraft world). I made it so ingame coordinates could be passed to a flatfile (type:string:x,z). I then worked on a stand alone program that would take a cartographer rendering, and draw the notes onto it. For testing, one of the types I used was all the player’s locations at the time. I like to think is the inspiration behind the current map viewers.</p>

          </div>
          <p>When hMod really started picking up heat and introduced plugins. I decided to use my Java skills I learned. I wanted a way for users to manage their own towns, and the more people in the town, the more perks. As the idea expanded, I eventually started planning that towns would be part of a hierarchy with nations at the top. I fist wrote mapper, which would show where the town was founded, but I kept getting user feedback that Towny should protect areas.</p>
          <p>My initial code was terrible. I tried writing my own XML parser/writer for persistence.</p>
          <p>When I finally decided on just a plain flatfile, and with the heirachy code done (but oh so buggy), I was ready to tackle integrating with another cuboid plugin for area protection. I started talking with some on IRC, and a dude was dishearted that I was just going to force players to use cuboid to select an area, and gave me the idea of having the town expand from a central point. Like a protective sphere.</p>
          <p>I started looking into cuboid and how it did block protection. This was around the time when dev’s started talking about how checking if a block was in a list of cuboids was a terrible idea. Eventually cuboid got on the path of using K-D Tree. That threw my sphere idea out, but I started on thinking about a chunk based system.</p>
